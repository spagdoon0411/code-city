# Code City

## About
Code City downloads a folder of single files from a remote GitHub repository, then visualizes them as buildings sized and arranged according to their class information.

## Version 1.0
- GitHub repositories are downloaded to a specified path
- Files are parsed and displayed in a 2D canvas
- The more methods a class has, the taller its building is
- The more fields a class has, the wider its building is
- Classes that are "important" (contain both many methods and many fields) are more opaque than less-contributing classes

## Team Members

- Spandan Suthar - Integration and display
- Tommy Choboter - File parser
